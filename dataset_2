No more information to report.\" We know there are more people affected and spreading this as we can see around the world in other countries, but we're being told, \"don't worry about it, we're safe.

This is a hidden data point that is causing the infection to spread. The CDC announced in early February they had thousands of tests to send out.

In vast majority of cases those symptoms subside fairly quickly, exactly like in case of flu. And exactly like in case of a flu, they can lead to viral pneumonia.\n\nThere are some differences: for example, coronavirus disease tends to have much worse progonosis in elderly (flu is very dangerous in elderly as well, but still less so). However, it seems less dangerous than seasonal flu in children, and about as in healthy adults. Vast majority of deaths from coronavirus disease were people in 60+ bracket, rest had pre-exisitng conditions like diabetes and CVDs (heart and blood vessel diseases), or were immunocompromised.\n\nOh, and as far as 'cold' goes... common cold is also viral disease, it also has similar symptoms, although usually less severe than flu and includes rhinorrhea, AKA runny nose (it doesn't mean flu can't present wtih runny nose). It too can lead to viral pneumonia.\n\nWhat helps spread of SARS-CoV-2 is longer time from exposure to onset of symptoms. For flu it's usually about 2-3 days upwards to a week, for coronaviurs it's about 5 days upwards to two weeks. It means there's longer period when person infected has no or very mild symptoms, but already potentially can infect others.\n\nThe other aspect not helping out is the fact we're just used to diseases like that: in vast majority of cases unless specifically tested either against antibodies or via PCR even from perspective of medical professional there's no real surefire way of telling if patient has coronavirus disease or any other viral disease presenting with similar symptoms. Reality is we're only 'seeing' it because it's slightly more deadly, but that doesn't mean flu isn't deadly or you can't die from common cold complications either.\n\nSo to /u/MarcelineMSU ... if your symptoms are severe obviously seek medical assistance but consider that what you're presenting with is consistent with what you'd also expect from flu or - given 'nose' aspect (runny nose, stuffed nose etc.) more likely just more severe cold.

The Dutch manufacturer of healthcare equipment fears that Philips Respironics in the American city of Pittsburgh will be brought under the Defense Production Act.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;With this Act of 1950, the time of the Korean War, President Trump can claim production and stocks of respiratory equipment. Philips is thus forced to supply only the American market. Supply to, for example, European countries then becomes impossible.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday that mandates his Health Minister Alex Azar to use the law or parts of it. Trump said to do so reluctantly, because he would be averse to government intervention in the economy. \"We don't like nationalization,\" the president said at his daily press conference on Sunday. \"Call Venezuela and see how that worked out there.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But under pressure, especially from Democrats in the House of Representatives, who are worried about acute shortages of respirators in American Covid-19 fireplaces, such as New York, Trump went over. The law hasn't been used yet, \"but as soon as it's needed, it will be used,\" Trump said.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"We're very concerned,\" said Philip's spokesman Steve Klink. Trump will hold a press conference this Monday (six o'clock tonight Dutch time). \"We're anxiously awaiting it.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Trade dispute  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In other parts of Europe, too, manufacturers of respirators fear the consequences of invoking the law. They point out that this could lead to an international trade conflict affecting corona patients.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Manufacturers of respirators depend on parts from all over the world - even Philips in Pittsburgh cannot do without parts made in Europe. In order to put pressure on the Americans, European companies may cease supply. No one wants that scenario, say those involved.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Philips 'does not want to speculate yet' about the consequences of an American claim. Klink: \"We're just doing what's needed now: increasing capacity.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Philips in Pittsburgh is now in the process of hiring an additional 50 employees. It wants to double the production of respirators in the next eight weeks - from a thousand to two thousand a week. \"And after those two months we want to double it again,\" says Klink. \"To do that we depend on our network of suppliers. We're all fighting the same clock.\" If one country, such as the United States, creates a barrier,\" says Klink, \"the global production and supply of respiratory equipment runs aground.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;According to the Independent American Medical Regulator Emergency Care Research Institute (ECRI), half of the ventilation equipment in American hospitals is produced by non-US companies. The experts warn that the city of New York alone will be short of more than 15,000 devices if the coronary pandemic reaches its calculated peak. To increase production, everyone in the world is dependent on each other, says ECRI director Marcus Schabacker in The New York Times. \"Whether you like it or not, every respirator maker in the world is looking for parts, and they all come from the same suppliers. Many of those suppliers are European and Asian.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Direct contact  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Philips-director Frans van Houten consulted with \"the most important competitors\" by telephone last weekend, says Philips-spokesman Klink. \"To discuss how we can scale up together. And then there's the question: are we going to be on time?\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Trumps claims law \"goes against how Philips views fair policy,\" says Klink. Philips is in direct contact with the U.S. government and U.S. health officials, trying to stop the law being invoked and \"convince them of the importance of cooperation and of open borders for production and supply,\" says Klink.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Does Philips have a plan B? \"Quickly in the Netherlands, as a stopgap solution, starting up the production of respirators is unfeasible.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In Europe, too, countries are trying to get a better grip on scarce supplies of medical supplies. For example, Germany announced a ban on the export of mouth masks, and the French government took control of the production of masks by manufacturers.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Netherlands has a variant on the American Defense Production Act, the Claims Act. Last week, SP and GroenLinks insisted on setting in motion a Claims Order that would allow the government to seize (medical) stocks of companies in extreme cases. On Sunday, the cabinet decided not to do so because it would \"deter foreign suppliers who supply to the Netherlands\".  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Translated with [www.DeepL.com/Translator](https://www.DeepL.com/Translator) (free version)", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "created_utc": 1584994011, "id": "flaz17r", "author": "svischar", "link_id": "t3_fnqtf8", "parent_id": "t3_fnqtf8", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": true, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "I'm not worried about COVID-19 for the same reason I'm not worried about catching the flu.

The president also told staffers to make sure other countries did not believe trade would be affected, and even sent a cleanup tweet of his own: \u201cThe restriction stops people not goods,\u201d he wrote.\n\nOther administration officials rushed to alert the public that U.S. citizens would be exempt from the travel ban, after scores of Americans, upon digesting Trump\u2019s speech, phoned government offices and raced to airports in Europe out of concern that they would not be able to fly home.\n\nTrump\u2019s 10-minute Oval Office address Wednesday night reflected not only his handling of the coronavirus crisis but, in some ways, much of his presidency. It was riddled with errors, nationalist and xenophobic in tone, limited in its empathy, and boastful of both his own decisions and the supremacy of the nation he leads.\n\nFutures for the Dow Jones industrial average fell in real time with virtually each word Trump uttered, signaling a lack of confidence among investors that he had control of the crisis and previewing another bloodbath once the markets opened Thursday morning.\n\nTrump \u2014 who believed that by giving the speech he would appear in command and that his remarks would reassure financial markets and the country \u2014 was in \u201can unusually foul mood\u201d and sounded at times \u201capoplectic\u201d on Thursday as he watched stocks tumble and digested widespread criticism of his speech, according to a former senior administration official briefed on his private conversations.\nThis official, like many others interviewed for this story, spoke on the condition of anonymity to share sensitive information or make candid assessments.\n\nBen Rhodes, a senior White House aide who helped former president Barack Obama script and manage his responses to numerous crises, predicted that Wednesday night\u2019s address will stand as \u201cthe moment people associate with the fact that Donald Trump failed the biggest test of his presidency.\u201d\n\nI think we\u2019ll look back on this as a defining moment of the Trump presidency because it speaks to larger concerns that people already had about Trump \u2014 that he can\u2019t tell the truth, that he doesn\u2019t value expertise, that he doesn\u2019t take the presidency seriously enough,\u201d Rhodes said.\n\nAs often is the case after Trump gives a major speech, his Republican allies offered a chorus of praise on television and social media for his \u201cfantastic speech\u201d and \u201cdecisive actions\u201d and \u201cunique strength.\u201d\n\nInside the White House, however, aides and advisers privately acknowledged that Trump failed to accomplish the primary goal of his speech \u2014 reassuring the nation \u2014 and described it as disappointing and far from his best performance.\n\nTrump\u2019s speech contained at least two errors and a significant omission. He said the travel ban would apply to cargo; it did not. He said health insurance companies would waive patients\u2019 co-payments for coronavirus testing and treatment; industry officials later clarified that they would waive payments for testing only. And he did not fully explain the details of his travel restrictions, leaving out the fact that U.S. citizens would be exempt.\n\nThe president\u2019s remarks were devoid of much substantive information on other matters. Trump provided no update for citizens on the spread of the virus, nor on the availability and results of testing.\n\nPublic health experts have said testing citizens for the coronavirus is essential for identifying new cases and limiting its spread, but the nation has experienced a chronic shortage of test kits after weeks of missteps by the government. Trump devoted only two short sentences to the topic, and they were vague: \u201cTesting and testing capabilities are expanding rapidly, day by day. We are moving very quickly.\u201d\n\nStylistically, the president himself seemed ill at ease in the formal setting, offering a monotone and labored delivery from behind the Resolute Desk, twiddling his thumbs and even, in moments, struggling to read words on the teleprompter. One senior administration official said Trump\u2019s heart was not in the speech.\n\n\u201cIt was jolting,\u201d said Julian Zelizer, a presidential historian at Princeton University. \u201cPeople are naturally scared. People want to see a leader who has a commanding presence. In some ways, the country is worse off after a message like that.\u201d\n\nThe speech itself was rushed. After weeks of playing down the coronavirus\u2019s threat to the United States, Trump was reluctant to appreciate the full scope of the crisis on his hands. But with the markets in free fall, he decided early Wednesday that he wanted to give the televised speech that night, administration officials said. This startled some of his aides and set off a frantic scramble to arrange airtime on television networks, iron out logistics for his delivery and prepare a draft of what he would say, the officials said.\n\n\u201cThis was a real missed opportunity to not just have a couple of sentences in there about how other people need to put partisanship aside and come together, but to really show it,\u201d the former senior administration official said, noting that Trump could have sought to rise above the politics of the moment to convey a sense of unity and common purpose.\n\n\u201cThe speech almost writes itself in a way,\u201d this person added. \u201cIt can be kind of formulaic. It\u2019s not rocket science.\u201d\n\nThe speech was largely written by Kushner and senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, who were still making tweaks to the text until moments before Trump delivered it, according to people familiar with the process. Thirty minutes before Trump appeared live on camera, a final draft of his remarks still had not circulated widely within the White House, one of those people said. And senior health experts in the administration did not review a final draft of the remarks, according to a senior administration official.\n\nWhile Kushner and Miller crafted the remarks, a coterie of other officials were involved in the process and joined Trump in the Oval Office to watch his delivery. One person with knowledge of the speech said they included Vice President Pence, Ivanka Trump, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, and a sizable group of White House aides: Christopher Liddell, Eric Ueland, Dan Scavino, Hogan Gidley, Judd Deere, John McEntee, Anthony Ornato and Nick Luna.\n\nSome officials faulted the rushed timeline for the messy speech, which they said could have been delivered even sooner, as it became clear the virus was well on its way to becoming a global pandemic \u2014 a designation the World Health Organization officially bestowed upon the coronavirus Wednesday.\n\n\u201cEveryone usually gets [Trump] where he needs to be within a couple of days,\u201d one official said. \u201cThe problem is we don\u2019t have a couple of days.\u201d\n\nKushner only recently became involved with the administration\u2019s virus response, beginning to attend meetings in his capacity as a senior adviser, according to officials, but inserted himself more fully as he became increasingly convinced that more tangible action was needed. He supported Trump\u2019s decision to ban most travel from Europe for 30 days and has pushed for further concrete steps, some of which are expected to be announced in the coming days, officials said.\n\nThere was some frustration among other White House aides at the sudden involvement by Kushner, who they viewed as simply parachuting in and whose vast portfolio \u2014 including Middle East peace negotiations, immigration and the reelection campaign \u2014 has been the subject of mockery in some circles.\n\nThe travel ban has been criticized by some experts for being largely ineffectual at this point considering the virus already has spread throughout the United States, as well as the fact that Trump exempted the United Kingdom, meaning anyone trying to fly to America from Europe could simply get to London first.\n\nTom Bossert, Trump\u2019s former homeland security adviser, was sharply critical of the measure, saying it would have been helpful earlier but now the key focus should be on community mitigation, such as closing schools or quarantining sick individuals.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s little value to European travel restrictions,\u201d Bossert tweeted Thursday morning. \u201cPoor use of time &amp; energy.\u201d\n\nOn NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show Thursday morning, host Savannah Guthrie read Pence \u2014 who is overseeing the administration\u2019s coronavirus response \u2014 a snippet of a Trump tweet in which the president accused \u201cthe Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party\u201d of trying to \u201cinflame the CoronaVirus situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been some irresponsible rhetoric,\u201d the vice president told Guthrie, before going on to praise Trump for his concern for the health and well-being of the American public.\n\nIt was initially unclear if Pence was perhaps criticizing his boss for the president\u2019s own \u201cirresponsible rhetoric.\u201d But when asked, an aide to the vice president quickly insisted that he was not.", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "created_utc": 1584061875, "id": "fkcv5dr", "author": "-ZeuS--", "link_id": "t3_fhrebq", "parent_id": "t3_fhrebq", "emotion": {"anger": true, "anticipation": true, "disgust": true, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": true, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "As there is no way to know what medications Corona patients are on, ESPECIALLY older patients or those with pre existing conditions, this has been locked.

The latter can be supported by the fact that some patients in this study had\n\nhyposmia. We also found that the lymphocyte counts were lower for patients with\n\nCNS symptoms than without CNS symptoms. This phenomenon may be indicative of\n\nthe immunosuppression in COVID-19 patients with CNS symptoms, especially in the\n\nsevere subgroup. Moreover, we found severe patients had higher D-dimer levels than\n\nthat of non-severe patients.

A frontline doctor\u2019s general description of symptoms for the Covid\u2019s first three weeks of illness.\n\n2. A day by day description of symptoms (from day 1 through day 12) and treatment for the first patient in the USA. He began feeling ill on Jan. 15, was admitted to the hospital on Jan. 20th, and was released from the hospital Feb. 3rd/4.\n\nSymptoms explained by Doctor ihttps://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/reporters-notebook-life-and-death-in-a-wuhan-coronavirus-icu: \n\n\u201cI've observed that the breakout period of the novel coronavirus tends to be three weeks, from the onset of symptoms to developing difficulties breathing. Basically going from mild to severe symptoms takes about a week. There are all sorts of mild symptoms: feebleness, shortness of breath, some people have fevers, some don't. Based on studies of our 138 cases, the most common symptoms in the first stage are fever (98.6 per cent of cases), feebleness (69.6 per cent), cough (59.4 per cent), muscle pains (34.8 per cent), difficulties breathing (31.2%), while less common symptoms include headaches, dizziness, stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting.\n\nBut some patients who enter the second week will suddenly get worse. At this stage, people should go to the hospital. The elderly with underlying conditions may develop complications; some may need machine-assisted respiration. When the body's other organs start to fail, that's when it becomes severe, while those with strong immune systems see their symptoms decrease in severity at this stage and gradually recover. So the second week is what determines whether the illness becomes critical.\n\nThe third week determines whether critical illness leads to death. Some in critical condition who receive treatment can raise their level of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, and see an improvement in their immune systems, and have been brought back, so to speak. But those whose lymphocyte numbers continue to decline, those whose immune systems are destroyed in the end, experience multiple organ failure and die.\n\nFor most, the illness is over in two weeks, whereas for those for whom the illness becomes severe, if they can survive three weeks, they're good. Those that can't will die in three weeks.\u201d\n\n\n2. And, this:\n\nSymptom Progression Day 1 to Day 12 From\nFirst Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States \n\n35 year old male\n\nhttps://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191\n\nOn January 19, 2020, a 35-year-old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider....\n\nGiven the patient\u2019s travel history, the local and state health departments were immediately notified. Together with the urgent care clinician, the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center. Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China, CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for 2019-nCoV on the basis of current CDC \u201cpersons under investigation\u201d case definitions.8 Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. After specimen collection, the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department.\nOn January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed that the patient\u2019s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.\n\nOn admission, the patient reported persistent dry cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting; he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain. Vital signs were within normal ranges. On physical examination, the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes. The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable. After admission, the patient received supportive care, including 2 liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea.\n\n\nOn days 2 through 5 of hospitalization (days 6 through 9 of illness), the patient\u2019s vital signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia (Figure 2). The patient continued to report a nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued. On the afternoon of hospital day 2, the patient passed a loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort. A second episode of loose stool was reported overnight; a sample of this stool was collected for rRT-PCR testing, along with additional respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and serum. The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT-PCR for 2019-nCoV, whereas the serum remained negative.\n\nTreatment during this time was largely supportive. For symptom management, the patient received, as needed, antipyretic therapy consisting of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours and 600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. He also received 600 mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately 6 liters of normal saline over the first 6 days of hospitalization.\n\n\nA chest radiograph taken on hospital day 3 (illness day 7) was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities (Figure 3). However, a second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung (Figure 4). These radiographic findings coincided with a change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient\u2019s oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed by 1 g administered intravenously every 8 hours) and cefepime (administered intravenously every 8 hours) was initiated.\n\n\nOn hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia (Figure 5), and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic findings, the decision to administer oxygen supplementation, the patient\u2019s ongoing fevers, the persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple sites, and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia3,4 at a period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development10,11) was initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued on the following day, after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.\n\nOn hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient\u2019s clinical condition improved. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation values improved to 94 to 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The previous bilateral lower-lobe rales were no longer present. His appetite improved, and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea. \n\nAs of January 30, 2020, the patient remains hospitalized. He is afebrile, and all symptoms have resolved with the exception of his cough, which is decreasing in severity.\n\n\n(The above referenced patient survived and was released from hospital and \u201cremains isolated at home.\u201d) see;\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.usnews.com/news/healthiest-communities/articles/2020-02-04/first-us-coronavirus-patient-released-from-hospital%3fcontext=amp\n\n\n(Please also see these relevant links contributed by r/u/Two_Luffas: \n\nThe JAMA related to the first story: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2761044\n\nHere's the Lancet case study from Jan. 24 : https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext\n\nThe NEJM case study, but includes all of the relevant supporting documents: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191\n\nAnother Lancet case study: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2820%2930211-7/fulltext\n\nLancet case study from Nepal: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30067-0/fulltext)", "subreddit": "China_Flu", "created_utc": 1583709943, "id": "fjz2lms", "author": "arewebeingplutoed", "link_id": "t3_ffl5ab", "parent_id": "t3_ffl5ab", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": false, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": true, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "Here you go:\n\nWhat Does the Coronavirus Do to the Body?\nHere\u2019s what scientists have learned about how the new virus infects and attacks cells and how it can affect organs beyond the lungs.\n\nAs cases of coronavirus infection proliferate around the world and governments take extraordinary measures to limit the spread, there is still a lot of confusion about what exactly the virus does to people\u2019s bodies.\nThe symptoms \u2014 fever, cough, shortness of breath \u2014 can signal any number of illnesses, from flu to strep to the common cold. Here is what medical experts and researchers have learned so far about the progression of the infection caused by this new coronavirus \u2014 and what they still don\u2019t know.\n\nHow does this coronavirus cause infection?\nThe virus is spread through droplets transmitted into the air from coughing or sneezing, which people nearby can take in through their nose, mouth or eyes. The viral particles in these droplets travel quickly to the back of your nasal passages and to the mucous membranes in the back of your throat, attaching to a particular receptor in cells, beginning there.\nCoronavirus particles have spiked proteins sticking out from their surfaces, and these spikes hook onto cell membranes, allowing the virus\u2019s genetic material to enter the human cell.\n\nThat genetic material proceeds to \u201chijack the metabolism of the cell and say, in effect, \u2018Don\u2019t do your usual job. Your job now is to help me multiply and make the virus,\u2019\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.\n\nHow does that process cause respiratory problems?\nAs copies of the virus multiply, they burst out and infect neighboring cells. The symptoms often start in the back of the throat with a sore throat and a dry cough.\n\nThe virus then \u201ccrawls progressively down the bronchial tubes,\u201d Dr. Schaffner said. When the virus reaches the lungs, their mucous membranes become inflamed. That can damage the alveoli or lung sacs and they have to work harder to carry out their function of supplying oxygen to the blood that circulates throughout our body and removing carbon dioxide from the blood so that it can be exhaled.\n\n\u201cIf you get swelling there, it makes it that much more difficult for oxygen to swim across the mucous membrane,\u201d said Dr. Amy Compton-Phillips, the chief clinical officer for the Providence Health System, which included the hospital in Everett, Wash., that had the first reported case of coronavirus in the United States, in January.\n\nThe swelling and the impaired flow of oxygen can cause those areas in the lungs to fill with fluid, pus and dead cells. Pneumonia, an infection in the lung, can occur.\n\nSome people have so much trouble breathing they need to be put on a ventilator. In the worst cases, known as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, the lungs fill with so much fluid that no amount of breathing support can help, and the patient dies.\n\nWhat trajectory does the virus take in the lungs?\nDr. Shu-Yuan Xiao, a professor of pathology at the University of Chicago School of Medicine has examined pathology reports on coronavirus patients in China. He said the virus appears to start in peripheral areas on both sides of the lung and can take a while to reach the upper respiratory tract, the trachea and other central airways.\n\nDr. Xiao, who also serves as the director of the Center For Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics at Wuhan University, said that pattern helps explain why in Wuhan, where the outbreak began, many of the earliest cases were not identified immediately.\nThe initial testing regimen in many Chinese hospitals did not always detect infection in the peripheral lungs, so some people with symptoms were sent home without treatment.\n\u201cThey\u2019d either go to other hospitals to seek treatment or stay home and infect their family,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons there was such a wide spread.\u201d\n\nA recent study from a team led by researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai found that more than half of 121 patients in China had normal CT scans early in their disease. That study and work by Dr. Xiao show that as the disease progresses, CT scans show \u201cground glass opacities,\u201d a kind of hazy veil in parts of the lung that are evident in many types of viral respiratory infections. Those opaque areas can scatter and thicken in places as the illness worsens, creating what radiologists call a \u201ccrazy paving\u201d pattern on the scan.\n\nAre the lungs the only part of the body affected?\nNot necessarily. Dr. Compton-Phillips said the infection can spread through the mucous membranes, from the nose down to the rectum.\nSo while the virus appears to zero in on the lungs, it may also be able to infect cells in the gastrointestinal system, experts say. This may be why some patients have symptoms like diarrhea or indigestion. The virus can also get into the bloodstream, Dr. Schaffner said.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that RNA from the new coronavirus has been detected in blood and stool specimens, but that it\u2019s unclear whether infectious virus can persist in blood or stool.\nBone marrow and organs like the liver can become inflamed too, said Dr. George Diaz, section leader for infectious diseases at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, Wash., whose team treated the first U.S. coronavirus patient. There may also be some inflammation in small blood vessels, as happened with SARS, the viral outbreak in 2002 and 2003.\n\u201cThe virus will actually land on organs like the heart, the kidney, the liver, and may cause some direct damage to those organs,\u201d Dr. Schaffner said. As the body\u2019s immune system shifts into high gear to battle the infection, the resulting inflammation may cause those organs to malfunction, he said.\nAs a result, some patients may endure damage that is inflicted not just by the virus, but by their own immune system as it rages to combat the infection.\n\nExperts have not yet documented whether the virus can affect the brain. But scientists who studied SARS have reported some evidence that the SARS virus could infiltrate the brain in some patients. Given the similarity between SARS and Covid-19, the infection caused by the new coronavirus, a paper published last month in the Journal of Medical Virology argued that the possibility that the new coronavirus might be able to infect some nerve cells should not be ruled out.\nWhy do some people get very ill but most don\u2019t?\nAbout 80 percent of people infected with the new coronavirus have relatively mild symptoms. But about 20 percent of people become more seriously ill and in about 2 percent of patients in China, which has had the most cases, the disease has been fatal.\nExperts say the effects appear to depend on how robust or weakened a person\u2019s immune system is. Older people or those with underlying health issues, like diabetes or another chronic illness, are more likely to develop severe symptoms.\nDr. Xiao conducted pathological examinations of two people in China who went into a hospital in Wuhan in January for a different reason \u2014 they needed surgery for early stage lung cancer \u2014 but whose records later showed that they had also had coronavirus infection, which the hospital did not recognize at the time. Neither patient\u2019s lung cancer was advanced enough to kill them, he said.\n\nOne of those patients, an 84-year-old woman with diabetes, died from pneumonia caused by coronavirus, Dr. Xiao said the records showed.\nThe other patient, a 73-year-old man, was somewhat healthier, with a history of hypertension that he had managed well for 20 years. Dr. Xiao said the man had successful surgery to remove a lung tumor, was discharged, and nine days later returned to the hospital because he had a fever and cough that was determined to be coronavirus.\nDr. Xiao said that the man had almost certainly been infected during his first stay in the hospital, since other patients in his post-surgical recovery room were later found to have coronavirus. Like many other cases, it took the man days to show respiratory symptoms.\nThe man recovered after 20 days in the hospital\u2019s infectious disease unit. Experts say that when patients like that recover, it is often because the supportive care \u2014 fluids, breathing support, and other treatment \u2014 allows them to outlast the worst effects of the inflammation caused by the virus.\n\nWhat do scientists still not know about coronavirus patients?\nA lot. Although the illness resembles SARS in many respects and has elements in common with influenza and pneumonia, the course a patient\u2019s coronavirus will take is not yet fully understood.\nSome patients can remain stable for over a week and then suddenly develop pneumonia, Dr. Diaz said. Some patients seem to recover but then develop symptoms again.\nDr. Xiao said that some patients in China recovered but got sick again, apparently because they had damaged and vulnerable lung tissue that was subsequently attacked by bacteria in their body. Some of those patients ended up dying from a bacterial infection, not the virus. But that didn\u2019t appear to cause the majority of deaths, he said.\nOther cases have been tragic mysteries. Dr. Xiao said he personally knew a man and woman who got infected, but seemed to be improving. Then the man deteriorated and was hospitalized.\n\n\u201cHe was in I.C.U., getting oxygen, and he texted his wife that he was getting better, he had good appetite and so on,\u201d Dr. Xiao said. \u201cBut then in the late afternoon, she stopped receiving texts from him. She didn\u2019t know what was going on. And by 10 p.m., she got a notice from the hospital that he had passed.\u201d", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "created_utc": 1583996803, "id": "fka8n5z", "author": "mrgrey5", "link_id": "t3_fhc89i", "parent_id": "t3_fhc89i", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": false, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": true, "pessimism": true, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "What about the other 50k odd people who got off a plane in your city yesterday?\n\nWho went on to touch 2mil people when they arrived that same day?\n\nYou can't stop a pandemic by being neurotic about a single person.\n\nBest way to control the spread of disease is to wash your hands.

And I ask for all the journalists here that you do not share nor propagandize the level 5 plans. Those are internally used within the government and medical system.\n\n- Level 4 is a situation where Vietnam has 1,000 infected cases. In reality up to now, we can confidently say we can treat up to 3,000 cases.\n\n- Level 5 is a situation where Vietnam has 30,000 cases. But we will not reveal the plans for this and I sincerely ask that you don't propagandize this. Because it can mislead people and make them think it will happen.\n\n- Anyhow, we have plans for all those scenarios, all those levels. In case any of those happens, a single call will start the procedure and the plans will be executed.\n\n- Because Vietnam has no epicenter yet, I use this \"5 fingers\" system to remind myself:\n1. We have to prevent the spread with all our might.\n2. We have to detect as quickly as possible\n3. We have to quarantine right away.\n4. We have to triangulate the potential infected zones\n5. We have to cure all the infected and disinfect all the virus once detected.\n\n- I joke that this is like treating a fire. We must pour water on the fire so quick and so effective that the fire is put out before we even here any sizzle.\n\n- We've decided that this is a global issue. We must work with the world. We will do strong methods that we believe will help, but at the same time we talk and convince the world about it too. \n\n- We've been working on this with China, and now we're working with S.Korea. And Italy, and Iran. We do not know if tomorrow there will be more countries. But we stress that the 5 points I mentioned earlier will not change. We must be determined.\n\n- We know this is an age of information. And in such an age the most important thing is transparency. We've worked with the media to report the most transparent info, not only on the news, but also on social media. The info must be fast and clear.\n\n- Only when the info is fast, clear and true, the people will understand and cooperate to fight against the plague. This fight is not only on the Health Ministry, or the Border Patrol. This fight is on every person in the country too.\n\n- This is the first time the whole People Army of Vietnam was deployed nationally.\n\n- I've known that because of news about how Vietnam has cured 16/16 patients, many regions have started being lax. I have to stress that we cannot drop our guard. We shouldn't be overdramatic, but we definitely must not be overconfident.\n\n\"Fight this plague like we fight a war.

The article is written from the parents' point of view; their account of what took place are all quotes from their lawyer. Any detail that would make the cop seem more guilty would have been included, and the details of what actually happened in the moment of the shooting are scarce. If the three of them had been facing away at the time of the shooting, that's what would be written in the article.\n\nA more plausible explanation, one that still matches the information given by the lawyer, is that Kenneth continued to advance, attack, or threaten in some way and that he was facing the officer at the time. He was hit in the shoulder first and then the back, and his parents (one of whom was shot in the abdomen, not the back) were hit by accident.\n\nWith this hypothetical scenario, I'm not trying to come up with a verdict of whether the cop was guilty or not, I'm trying to form a plausible explanation for what events actually took place. In my opinion, it's not plausible that they were all running away from him because the article would have said so if they were. If you look at other articles about this shooting ([1](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-costco-shooting-explainer-narrative-20190619-story.html), [2](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-costco-shooting-off-duty-lapd-officer-20190617-story.html), [3](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-costco-dispute-lapd-shooting-corona-20190618-story.html)), they are much more heavily biased towards the cop, making sure to mention the age of his 18-month old son whom he was holding, always specifying that the punch or shove was unprovoked, claiming that he was knocked unconscious by it, going into detail about the rights and responsibilities of off-duty officers, and explaining Kenneth's disability including the fact that he have been having a reaction to a change in medication. These articles\u2014the CNN one and the LA Times ones\u2014aren't for telling people what happened; they tell us how we should feel. All of them have an agenda. Taking the article that's biased towards the family and making additional leaps in their favor like \"I guess they all had their backs to him\" doesn't make much sense to me.\n\nIt may be that in the instant of the shooting, there was nothing threatening about Kenneth's behavior, and the officer shot him because he irrationally perceived a continuing threat where there was none, due to his young son having been placed in danger. That is the scenario that I was addressing in my original post. The scenario that places *more* blame upon the officer than the self-defense scenario.

Figure 2 shows\nthe number of deaths by age group. Women who died after contracting COVID-19 infection\nthey are older than men (median ages: women 83.7 - men 79.5).  \n\n&gt; **3. Pre-existing pathologies**    \n&gt; Table 1 presents the most common pre-existing chronic pathologies (diagnosed before contracting\ninfection) in deceased patients. This figure was obtained in 355/2003 deaths (17.7% of the sample\ntotal). The average number of pathologies observed in this population is 2.7 (median 2, Deviation\nStandard 1.6). Overall, 3 patients (0.8% of the sample) had 0 pathologies, 8 9 (25.1%)\nhad 1 pathology, 91 had 2 pathologies (25.6%) and 172 (48.5%) had 3 or more pathologies.\n  \n&gt; **4.

Complications**    \n&gt; Respiratory failure was the most commonly observed complication in this sample (97.2%\nof cases), acute kidney damage (27.8%), followed by acute myocardial damage (10.8%) and superinfection (10.2%)\n\n&gt; **6.

But officials are contending with deep anger from the Chinese public, with many people still seething over the government\u2019s early efforts to conceal the crisis.\n\nMr. Ren, a party member, is well known for his searing critiques of Mr. Xi. In 2016, the party placed him on a year\u2019s probation for denouncing Mr. Xi\u2019s propaganda policies in comments online.\n\nThe government has monitored Mr. Ren\u2019s movements intensely ever since, friends said, preventing him from leaving the country and deleting his social media accounts, where he had built a wide following.\n\nHis whereabouts was unclear on Saturday, and the police in Beijing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very worried about him,\u201d said Wang Ying, a retired entrepreneur and friend of Mr. Ren\u2019s. \u201cI will continue to look for him.\u201d\nIn recent weeks, an essay by Mr. Ren began circulating among elite circles in China and abroad. In it, he blamed the government for silencing whistle-blowers and trying to conceal the outbreak, which began in the central city of Wuhan in December.\n\nWhile he did not explicitly use Mr. Xi\u2019s name in the commentary, Mr. Ren left no doubt he was speaking about China\u2019s leader, repeatedly referencing Mr. Xi\u2019s speeches and actions.\n\n\u201cI see not an emperor standing there exhibiting his \u2018new clothes,\u2019 but a clown who stripped naked and insisted on continuing to be an emperor,\u201d he wrote.\nAddressing Mr. Xi, he wrote: \u201cYou don\u2019t in the slightest hide your resolute ambition to be an emperor and your determination to destroy anyone who won\u2019t let you.\u201d\n\nMr. Ren, 69, is the retired chairman of Huayuan Properties, a real estate developer. In 2016, Mr. Ren came under scrutiny after writing on his microblog that China\u2019s news media should serve the people, not the party, contradicting one of Mr. Xi\u2019s high-profile pronouncements. His remarks offered a window into growing frustration among Chinese intellectuals and entrepreneurs over Mr. Xi\u2019s increasingly authoritarian rule.\n\nThe party moved quickly to censure him, saying he had \u201clost his party spirit.\u201d But he continued to speak out on other topics, such as China\u2019s strict policies to limit the population in big cities.\nAs more details about China\u2019s efforts to cover up the coronavirus outbreak have been disclosed by the Chinese news media in recent weeks, Mr. Xi has come under attack from several prominent Chinese activists and intellectuals.\n\nXu Zhangrun, a law professor in Beijing, published an essay last month saying that the epidemic had \u201crevealed the rotten core of Chinese governance.\u201d\n\nXu Zhiyong, a prominent legal activist, released a letter to Mr. Xi on social media, accusing him of a cover-up and calling on him to step down. He was later detained.\n\nActivists said Mr. Ren\u2019s disappearance was a worrying sign that the government was escalating its latest crackdown on free speech.\n\n\u201cThe epidemic has brought out the worst of Xi Jinping,\u201d said Yang Jianli, a rights activist based in the United States. \u201cHe is so determined not to give an inch, rightly understanding an inch would mean hundreds of miles.\u201d", "subreddit": "worldpolitics", "created_utc": 1584239388, "id": "fkj91vu", "author": "cuteshooter", "link_id": "t3_fiuat0", "parent_id": "t3_fiuat0", "emotion": {"anger": true, "anticipation": true, "disgust": true, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "Will Florida become the main destination in the U.S. for faithful Trump supporters running away from the coronavirus?  \n        \nHow many Trump supporters in Washington and other states, who fear or think they might become  infected or fear they already might be infected with the coronavirus, will make the pilgrimage to Trump's home state because they believe the heat and the miracle that almighty Trump publicly talked about might give them special protection from the coronavirus?  \n          \nMight one, one thousand, or some other number of  faithful Trump supporters form caravans to make the pilgrimage to Florida because they faithfully believe the heat and the miracle Trump talked about will protect them from the coronavirus?  \n                 \nWhat would be the best destinations for all of Trump's faithful worshippers?

The \u201cpandemic response team\u201d firing claim referred to\u00a0news\u00a0accounts\u00a0from Spring 2018 reporting that White House officials tasked with directing a national response to a pandemic had been ousted.\n\nRear Adm. Timothy Ziemer abruptly departed from his post leading the global health security team on the National Security Council in May 2018 amid a reorganization of the council by then-National Security Advisor John Bolton, and Ziemer\u2019s team was disbanded. Tom Bossert, whom the Washington Post reported \u201chad called for a comprehensive biodefense strategy against pandemics and biological attacks,\u201d had been\u00a0fired\u00a0one month prior.\n\nIt\u2019s thus true that the Trump administration axed the executive branch team responsible for coordinating a response to a pandemic and did not replace it, eliminating Ziemer\u2019s position and reassigning others, although Bolton was the executive at the top of the National Security Council chain of command at the time.\n\nLegum\u00a0stated\u00a0in a follow-up tweet that \u201cTrump also cut funding for the CDC, forcing the CDC to cancel its efforts to help countries prevent infectious-disease threats from becoming epidemics in 39 of 49 countries in 2018. Among the countries abandoned? China.\u201d That information was confirmed by 2018 news\u00a0reports\u00a0stating that funding for the CDC\u2019s global disease outbreak prevention efforts had been cut by 80%, including funding for the agency\u2019s efforts in China.\n\nOn Feb. 24, 2020, the Trump administration requested $2.5 billion to address the coronavirus outbreak, an outlay critics asserted might not have been necessary if the previous program cuts had not taken place. Fortune\u00a0reported\u00a0of the issue that:\n\n&gt;The cuts could be especially problematic as COVID-19 continues to spread.

The results show that the previous estimations weren\u2019t far off.\n\nFINDINGS\n\u201cThe scientists found that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was detectable in aerosols for up to three hours, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel,\u201d A summary by the NIH reads. \u201cThe results provide key information about the stability of SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19 disease, and suggests that people may acquire the virus through the air and after touching contaminated objects.\u201d\n\nScientists tested the virus on five different environments:\n\nAerosol\nCopper\nCardboard\nStainless Steel\nPlastic\nThe main findings represent how long the virus CAN survive, but that doesn\u2019t mean that it always WILL:\n\nAerosol: Less than 3 hours\nCopper: Less than 4 hours\nCardboard: Less than 24 hours\nStainless Steel: Less than 72 hours\nPlastic: Less than 72 hours\nOfficials said the virus\u2019s survivability is impacted by outside factors like temperature and humidity, but the test was conducted in a controlled environment. The temperature was kept between 70-73 degrees and a 40-percent humidity was maintained.\n\nThis means that in a perfect lab environment, the virus can survive this long, however in a real-world situation, other factors could lower survivability.\n\nThe main takeaway here is that individuals should be cautious of most surfaces right now.

I arrive early to our interview at the Writers Bar at the Raffles Hotel in Makati\u2014she sits on a plush loveseat wrapping up an interview while I stand by an identical seat a few meters away. For a second, our eyes meet. In the dream, her eyes narrow ever so slightly as though she\u2019s sniffed me out: bohemian floral dress but corporate laptop case, I see her thinking, green Sharpie user, her eyes say, but reporter\u2019s notebook. We\u2019re like two slingers preparing to draw. Bohemian fringe, she sees me think, but moneyed enough for that string of pearls. Poet, she sees me raise an eyebrow, but a bestselling author. At that point in the dream, I waltz, Cherie Gil-like to where she\u2019s seated. \u201cYou\u2019re not a journalist,\u201d she tells me, \u201cAnd you\u2019re not a poet,\u201d I tell her. And then, in that flush nanosecond before she can call me nothing but a second-rate, trying-hard copycat, I wake up.\n\nIn reality, Lang Leav is every poet\u2019s best dream and worst nightmare. She\u2019s the proto-Instapoet, the proto-Kaur, beloved by millions of young adults scrawling \u201cverse\u201d along the margins of their Corona notebooks during Algebra class, the author of titles for which she is callously judged, among them, Love &amp; Misadventure (2013), Memories (2015), Sad Girls (2017), and most recently, Love Looks Pretty on You (2019). Her books have sold in the staggering millions, which qualifies her as a legitimate enterprise as far as bestselling authors go. She also has half a million followers on her Instagram account, which qualifies her as a viable peddler of influence. All of this for writing poetry (or, for the snobs among us, \u201cpoetry\u201d).\n\n\nThe poet reading her work\nIn recent years, poets of the insta-species have inspired both blind devotion and blind ire. They have been made projects of, as in the case of serious, Pushcart Prize-nominated poet Thom Young, who wrote meaningless she-poems on his Instagram account just to illustrate how many likes bad verse could generate on the social media platform (answer: tens of thousands). Back to regular programming, Young averages out to about 100 likes on his Instagram poems. Young is dying to instruct his social media audience that what they consider poetry is smut; he\u2019s Cross-on-Golgotha intent to save them from the Kardashian predilections of their simple hearts.\n\nBut Leav has no such pretensions. \u201cI feel that, you know, you\u2019ve got to be able to trust your readers,\u201d Leav tells me. \u201cI feel that, in the end, the poets that are successful, and the ones that are doing really well have a certain quality to their work, have a certain standard there. And I feel that that is something that we should trust to the readers. I feel that we don\u2019t give the readers enough credit in what they do.\u201d\n\nIf I were asshole enough to pull out the race and establishment card(s), I would qualify Young as a hopeful to the western canon, and Leav as the super-subaltern. Leav was born in a refugee camp in Thailand after her mother fled the Khmer Rouge for a temporary haven.\n\nLang herself was raised in Sydney, and tells as compelling an immigrant story as the best of them out there. \u201cI think about my mom and what she went through,\u201d Leav says. \u201cShe was actually on the run from the Khmer Rouge when she was pregnant with me, and I have to think that that was how my life started\u2014in all that turmoil and angst\u2014and you know, it\u2019s just a really strange thing to think about, because I\u2019m sure, in her womb, I was at peace.\u201d\n\n\nIn the midst of that war, Leav continues, her mother created her, \u201ca little oasis of peace.\u201d  Leav goes on: \u201cShe obviously didn\u2019t know she was pregnant, and when she found out, she didn\u2019t know if I would even make it. It\u2019s probably quite a tough thing for a baby growing up in a refugee camp. So against all odds, here I am.\u201d  Whether or not this is gospel truth, it\u2019s an accepted one\u2014enough to dismiss Young\u2019s cause as the ramblings of a first-world poet. To further qualify her as a substantial ally (note: I say ally, and not figure) of literature, Leav writes about female empowerment in her latest book. \u201cWhat sort of alarms me is that a lot of hate is directed especially to women writers\u2014and especially to girls that are just starting out\u2014and it pains me to see that these people have no idea what they\u2019re talking about. Yet they\u2019re attacking young writers. I just want young writers to know that it\u2019s quite a perilous thing growing up as a writer and trying to get your work out there on social media, which is something you should absolutely do, and you should have the freedom to do it without people treating you cruelly.\u201d\n\nLeav is talking about sixteen-year-old boys dissing female classmates on their parents\u2019 computers, but how different are those boys, really, from poets like Young.\n\nAt this point, I note that my dream is speckled with some truth. I have never read a Lang Leav\u200b book from cover to cover. I do not know that this is her fourth visit to the Philippines. I am not aware that she has written a book called Sea of Strangers, whose imagery draws heavily on the surrounds of Leav\u2019s current home by the sea\u2014one punctuated by birdsong and the fitful sighs of a nearby ocean. Which is to say, I do not champion social media as a viable platform for good literature, but Leav has been one of the first to show us its democratizing power. She talks about Instapoetry as a movement, born out of a necessity. \u201cWe\u2019re not policed by the establishment now,\u201d she says.\n\nBut perhaps what she and the other Instapoets have done is create a new establishment\u2014one that\u2019s influenced and perpetuated a new kind of readership. A readership for whom a line like Don\u2019t Stay where you are needed. Go where you are loved (Leav, 2019), is not an aphorism, it\u2019s a poem. Some years ago, I went to the poetry section in a leading bookstore in Makati and all I saw was shelf upon shelf of books by Leav and her partner Michael Faudet (Man or myth? A query for another time). Where was Shakespeare? Where was Oliver, Forch\u00e9, or Rich, or Berryman or Plath?\n\n\nLang Leav amused by passages from her book\n\u201cHistory will look back on this time and see it for what it is, and the significance of how it\u2019s drawn a lot of the youth and the younger generation to reading poetry again. It\u2019s a beautiful thing,\u201d Leav says. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s talking about her own poetry, or Instapoetry in general, but perhaps the hope is that she serves as a gateway poet leading the young to the likes Dickinson and Frost\u2014two poets Leav grew up reading; or to Plath and Sexton who would have done well in the age of confessional couplets. The question for me is not whether or not Instapoetry is a viable poetry, but what kind of new reader it\u2019s creating. It\u2019s a question my writer-husband and I have discussed for at least an hour tonight\u2014an eon in the Instagram age.\n\nI\u2019ve come to this interview prepared to laugh off Leav, but we\u2019ve just spoken to each other in a place called the Writers Bar. For a brief spell, all we are are two writers talking shop to each other on a lit Makati morning, in the plush interiors of a hotel space no writer I know has ever written in. We both call ourselves poets, but like a Lang Leav poem, \u201cI can already picture us ten years from now, living our lives like parallel lines.\u201d Which is to say it is likely our paths won\u2019t cross again.\n\nKnowing this, I do the predictable thing and ask Leav for a selfie\u2014to which she responds by drawing me to the most Instagrammable nook in the whole place\u2014a towering bookcase scrunched to the hilt with pastel-colored spines. \u201cMy book matches your dress,\u201d she says, and gamely complies.", "subreddit": "Philippines", "created_utc": 1551073266, "id": "eh87uld", "author": "bituin_the_lines", "link_id": "t3_auhl4a", "parent_id": "t3_auhl4a", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "disgust": false, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": true}, {"body": "Eto kumakalat sa viber:\n\n\nEspecially, in this nation-wide health crisis, as a Filipino who is living in the Philippines:\n\nIf I want a better President, I WILL PRAY for the one we have.\nIf I want a better Health Secretary, I WILL PRAY for the one we have.\nIf I want a better City Mayor, I WILL PRAY for the one we have.\nIf I want better medical professionals, I WILL PRAY for all of them.\nIf I want a better AFP and PNP, I WILL PRAY for all of them in the rank and file.\n\nBecause they are not perfect but they are the ones in position.\nBecause criticizing them will not alleviate our situation.\nBecause mocking their sincere efforts is despicable.\nBecause I am not a smart aleck and I am not perfect.\nBecause if I were in their shoes, I doubt if I can do better.\nBecause this is not the time for political colors.\nBecause our nation\u2019s well-being is more important than our political alliances.\nBecause this is the time to be united, not to further divide.\nBecause it is my Christian duty to pray for those in authority.\nBecause GOD IS IN CONTROL.\n\nBe careful for nothing; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.

That places Mr. Xi\u2019s involvement with fighting the epidemic earlier than previously known. Mr. Xi\u2019s earliest public comment on the epidemic was Jan. 20, when he gave brief instructions on the issue that were published by state media.\n\nIn early January, leaders in Wuhan, the city at the epicenter of the outbreak, were giving open assurances that there was no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.

Here are some other main points from the newly published Feb. 3 speech:\n\nMr. Xi in charge: Mr. Xi emphasized that he has been constantly involved in decisions about the crisis, and he indicates that he gave the authorization to put Wuhan and other areas of Hubei under an unprecedented lockdown from Jan. 23. In the speech, Mr. Xi recalled: \u201cI clearly demanded that Hubei Province exercise comprehensive, strict control over the outflow of individuals.\u201d\n\nYou have 4 free articles remaining.\nSubscribe to The Times\nTwo focal points in a nationwide \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019: Mr. Xi describes the effort to end the epidemic as an all-encompassing \u201cpeople\u2019s war\u201d across China. But he singles out two key battlegrounds: Hubei Province, where the infections and deaths have been concentrated, and Beijing, the national capital. \u201cBeijing has a special status,\u201d Mr. Xi told the meeting. He said: \u201cStrengthen management and control of key populations.\u201d\n\nControlling the narrative: Mr. Xi stresses the importance of preserving social stability through easing public fear, providing adequate supplies of food and other needs, and demonstrating confidence that the epidemic can be beaten. And he also emphasizes winning over public opinion at home and abroad. \u201cThere must be closer monitoring and assessment of opinion, proactively speaking out and giving positive guidance,\u201d Mr. Xi said of Chinese public sentiment. \u201cSeize the initiative and effectively shape international opinion,\u201d he added. \u201cTell well the story of China\u2019s fight against the epidemic.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nContinue reading the main story\nCoping with economic damage: Mr. Xi acknowledges that the epidemic and fight to curtail it will drag on China\u2019s economy by putting pressure on industry, especially smaller firms; by slowing construction projects; and by cooling domestic and foreign trade. In response, Mr. Xi said, the government will provide financial support for businesses, help migrant workers return to their jobs when production resumes, and step up support for projects.

We\u2019ll find a virus and say a vaccine must be produced.\u201d\n\nOne research-estimate suggests there are 320,000 viruses on Earth that infect mammals.\n\nThis means: types of viruses. For each type, I suppose you could say there are at least trillions of individual viruses.\n\nSo we should all be dead. Long gone. But we aren\u2019t.\n\nFirst of all, there are what\u2019s called endogenous viruses. They live in the human body and they watch television and they lie around and don\u2019t cause illness. On sophisticated tests, they can show up, and researchers will mistakenly assume they\u2019re doing damage. They\u2019re doing nothing.\n\nThen there are exogenous viruses. They come in from the outside, enter the body, and look for cells in which they can take up residence and multiply. The immune system notices, and either ignores them as trifling or mounts a defense to defeat them. These viruses can also show up on sophisticated tests. Researchers tend to (falsely) believe the mere presence of the viruses signals trouble (illness).\n\nThis is a massive mistake. So-called viral infection, if it means anything significant at all, amounts to much more than mere presence. A few particles of virus showing up on a test says nothing about actual illness. There must be millions and millions of a virus actively replicating in the body to cause disease.\n\nAnd even then, a healthy and strong immune system could ultimately defeat this bunch of little doofuses.\n\nThat leaves who knows how many other viruses out there, never living in or entering the human body at all. They\u2019re playing music or their version of baseball or finding warm condos in cows or sheep or moose.\n\nNow we come to what-if type speculations. Suppose dangerous viruses are flying in from planets far away? Suppose they\u2019re combining in caves and then crawling into the bodies of rock climbers? Suppose biowar labs are fiddling and diddling and cooking up altered versions of several viruses that will kill millions of people? CAN YOU PROVE THIS ISN\u2019T SO?\n\nNo I can\u2019t, just as I can\u2019t prove that a purple and white snake in the Orion Belt isn\u2019t building a radio.\n\nBut I can say this. Doing research on biowar germs isn\u2019t the same thing as doing successful research on them. Assuming these scientists are actually developing biowar germs that work\u2026well, in a recent article titled \u201cPeople dying equals coronavirus?\u201d, I posted several old dire warnings about past viral epidemics: SARS was weaponized. So was Zika. So was Swine Flu. So was Ebola. And yet\u2026these epidemics were duds.\n\nBut you see, the people issuing those dire warnings back then didn\u2019t care, and don\u2019t care now, that their predictions never materialized. They don\u2019t care. Every time a new epidemic is announced by some public health agency, they state brand new warnings.\n\nWe humans may routinely be able to fend off and defeat, naturally, 100 trillion trillion viruses in the environment, but this weaponized virus is going to kill us all. Soon.\n\nIn the current \u201ccoronavirus epic,\u201d there is one new feature the prophets of doom can exploit: after the word comes down that it\u2019s over and done, they can say, \u201cWell, you see, actually more than two million people in China died from the virus. The government there is covering it up. It WAS a bioweapon. PROVE THAT IT WASN\u2019T.\u201d\n\nThere is one more category of virus I should mention. I have detailed it in past articles. It\u2019s the virus that isn\u2019t there at all. It\u2019s a beauty. Researchers perform various procedures aimed at detecting it, but these scientists invent MARKERS they CLAIM are indirect evidence of a virus they can\u2019t directly pinpoint. From such lunatic procedures, a whole story and tale and legend about the virus they never found is created. The pros can even report this never-discovered virus is causing a global epidemic. It\u2019s a marvel.\n\nThey might go on to develop a vaccine against the never-detected virus. A toxic vaccine.\n\nOr they can say, \u201cAll our efforts to produce an effective vaccine against virus X have so far fallen short.\u201d Meaning: \u201cHow could we make a vaccine against a virus we never found?\u201d\n\nJust wait a while. Eventually, they\u2019ll figure out a way.\n\n\u201cAfter, ahem, synthesizing a gene from a specimen of the neuro-electric imprint of the shadow of the recalcitrant cave-hiding virus, we were able to inject the gene in volunteers and reduce the presence of indirect marker CR65-35 by 27.243 percent. We\u2019re confident a vaccine derived from the gene will prove effective in 74.2657843265 percent of healthy individuals. If they get sick, don\u2019t blame us. Blame the virus.
